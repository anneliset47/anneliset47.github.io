I am a data scientist in training with a biology background and over four years of clinical research experience. Currently completing a MS in Data Science at CU Boulder, I specialize in healthcare and genomic data analysis to support research and treatment outcomes.

My experience spans cancer genetics, rare genetic disorders, and molecular biology. I work with cross-functional teams that include genetic counselors, clinical researchers, and bioinformaticians. My goal is to turn data into tools that improve patient care and advance biological discovery.

Tools: Python, R, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, SQL, Tableau, Spark
Focus Areas: Genomics, Clinical Trials, Electronic Health Records, Cancer Screening, Rare Disease Research

I am seeking full-time data science roles with a focus on healthcare, biotech, or biomedical research.
