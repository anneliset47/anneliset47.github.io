## CU Anchsutz Clinical Genomics Internship
- ### Tandem Repeat Variant Frequency Plots
    - [Variant Frequency Plotting Algorithm](https://github.com/anneliset47/anneliset47.github.io/blob/main/Projects/Anschutz_PlottingAlgorithm_88sampless.py): For this assignment, I wrote a python algorithm to extract tandem repeat variant frequency data from VCF files and plot them using plotly. The plots are interactive and labeled with Benign and Pathogenic regions that were extracted from a JSON file.
