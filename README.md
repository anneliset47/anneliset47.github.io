## Course Work
- ### Data Structures and Algorithms
    - [Traffic using Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://github.com/anneliset47/anneliset47.github.io/blob/main/DSA_Dijkstra'sAlgorithm_Traffic.ipynb): For this assignment, I first used Dijkstra's Algorithm to evaluate the shortest route in time from a designated initial point (A) to a final destination point (J). Then, I evaluated the shorted route between two points in rush hour with high traffic, which causes delays on most of the routes.
    - [Table of Contents](https://github.com/anneliset47/anneliset47.github.io/blob/main/DSA_TableofContents.ipynb): In this file, I created a table of contents for a Data Science technical book using a tree structure to organize my data hierarchically. Additionally, I developed two functions- one to insert chapters or subchapter titles and another to print the table of contents.
    - [Book Analysis](https://github.com/anneliset47/anneliset47.github.io/blob/main/DSA_BookAnalysis.ipynb): In this file, I analyzed the book "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" and identified the distribution of each letter from a to z, the top 40 words used in the text, the top 20 bigrams used in the text, and the top 20 trigrams used in the text.
    - [Probability of Coincidences Related to Birthdays](https://github.com/anneliset47/anneliset47.github.io/blob/main/DSA_ProbabilityofCoincidencesRelatedtoBirthdays.ipynb): In this assignment, I developed algorithms to calculate probabilities for shared birthdays, specific birthday distributions, and age statistics. I optimized each algorithm for scalability, analyzing their complexities, and used Matplotlib to visually represent the results. Additionally, I modified the algorithms to handle large datasets, ensuring they remained efficient with 1,000,000 members.
- ### Data Mining
    - [Opioid Crisis Project](https://sites.google.com/view/data-mining-project-group-one): This project is a comprehensive group assignment that applies concepts learned in the Data Mining course. My team and I worked with real data about the opioid crisis to answer research questions, perform data mining techniques, and communicate findings through a professional project website.         
- ### Information Visualization
    - [Real World Chart Transformations Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10Q5qovXs2K-rzptclcjIPUHhX2IiyxiJ/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116256978185437743055&rtpof=true&sd=true): I redesigned three poorly made real-world charts by analyzing their context and identifying key issues such as clutter, poor storytelling, and cognitive overload. I applied data visualization best practices to create clearer, more effective alternatives using Google Sheets. I then presented the improvements in a slide deck and led a 15-minute discussion with peers acting as stakeholders.
    - [Real World Data Dashboard](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dVRHkbIT6qzb0-3JFs2Tq9DzaA7MN2vv/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116256978185437743055&rtpof=true&sd=true): I designed a dashboard in Power BI to explore the relationship between student behavior and academic performance using real-world data. The dashboard visualizes metrics such as study hours, sleep, stress, attendance, and participation, broken down by grade, gender, and department. I presented this analysis to stakeholders, emphasizing patterns and insights through clear visuals and user-friendly design.
